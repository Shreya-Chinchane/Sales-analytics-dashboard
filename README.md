# Shark_Tank_analysis

This project focuses on creating a comprehensive data analytics dashboard that visualizes the "Top Investments in Shark Tank India Dataset." The primary objective is to analyze and showcase key trends and insights from the investment deals made on the popular television show Shark Tank India.

# Walkthrough of the project


The dashboard provides an intuitive interface for entrepreneurs, investors, and researchers to explore critical aspects of the Indian startup ecosystem. By presenting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as Total Investment, Highest Deal, Most Active Shark, and Industry Insights, it offers a data-driven perspective on the success of pitches, the distribution of investments across industries, and the role of individual investors ("Sharks").

Core functionalities include interactive graphs, filters for episode and industry type, and an analysis of investment trends over time. This project highlights the diversity of startups that received funding, solving the challenge of understanding where and how venture capital flows within India's dynamic entrepreneurial landscape.
